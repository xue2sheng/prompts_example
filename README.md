## Preplexity

### without role prompt

The correct pronunciation of participle endings in English (typically the "-ed" ending in regular verbs and participles) follows three main patterns, depending on the final sound of the verb:

    ### Main Pronunciation Rules

    - **/ɪd/**: When the verb ends in the sounds /t/ or /d/, the "-ed" is pronounced as an extra syllable — like "wanted" (/ˈwɒntɪd/), "needed" (/ˈniːdɪd/), or "ended" (/ˈɛndɪd/). This is the only pattern that adds an extra syllable to the word.[3][5][7][16]
    - **/t/**: When the verb ends in an unvoiced (voiceless) consonant sound (except /t/), such as /p/, /f/, /s/, /ʃ/ (sh), /ʧ/ (ch), or /k/, the "-ed" is pronounced as /t/ (without any extra syllable), for example "talked" (/tɔːkt/), "kissed" (/kɪst/), "laughed" (/læft/), "watched" (/wɒtʃt/), "liked" (/laɪkt/).[5][7][16][3]
    - **/d/**: When the verb ends in a vowel sound or a voiced consonant sound (except /d/), such as /l/, /n/, /m/, /g/, /v/, /z/, /b/, /r/, or any vowel, the "-ed" is pronounced as /d/ with no extra syllable. Examples include "played" (/pleɪd/), "closed" (/kləʊzd/), "lived" (/lɪvd/), "allowed" (/əˈlaʊd/).[7][16][3][5]

    ### Quick Reference Table

    | Ending Sound             | Example base verb | Example with -ed | Pronunciation | Extra Syllable? |
    |-------------------------|-------------------|------------------|---------------|-----------------|
    | /t/, /d/                | want, end         | wanted, ended    | /ɪd/          | Yes             |
    | Voiceless consonant      | like, stop, cook  | liked, stopped, cooked | /t/      | No              |
    | Voiced (vowel/consonant) | play, allow, live | played, allowed, lived | /d/     | No              |[3][7]

    ### Additional Notes

    - The distinction is based on the sound, not necessarily the spelling. For example, "fax" is spelled with an "x", but the sound is /s/, which is voiceless, so pronounced /t/: "faxed" (/fækst/).
    - All vowels are always voiced.
    - Adjectives that use "-ed" endings follow the same rules as regular verbs.[3][7]

    This way, mastering the correct pronunciation of participle endings will help improve clarity and natural fluency in English speech.[16][5][7][3]

### with role prompt

    The correct way to pronounce participle endings (“-ed”) in English depends on the final sound of the verb. There are three regular pronunciations: /ɪd/, /t/, and /d/.[1][5][7]

    ### Three Pronunciation Rules

    - If the verb ends in “t” or “d”, pronounce “-ed” as /ɪd/. This adds an extra syllable, like in “wanted” (wanted) /ˈwɒn.tɪd/ or “needed” (needed) /ˈniː.dɪd/.[7][1]
    - If the verb ends in an unvoiced (no vibration) sound like “p”, “k”, “s”, “f”, “ʃ” (sh), or “ʧ” (ch), pronounce “-ed” as /t/: “worked” (worked) /wɜːkt/, “kissed” (kissed) /kɪst/.[5][1][7]
    - For verbs ending in any other voiced sound (with vibration, like “l”, “n”, “r”, “v”, “z”, “b”, “g”, “m”), pronounce “-ed” as /d/: “lived” (lived) /lɪvd/, “cleaned” (cleaned) /kliːnd/, “played” (played) /pleɪd/.[1][5][7]

    ### Example Table

    | Verb base | Final sound | -ed pronunciation | Example      |
    |-----------|-------------|-------------------|--------------|
    | want      | t           | /ɪd/              | wanted  |
    | hope      | p           | /t/               | hoped  |
    | play      | y           | /d/               | played  |
    | end       | d           | /ɪd/              | ended  |
    | laugh     | f           | /t/               | laughed  |
    | clean     | n           | /d/               | cleaned  |

    ### Tips for Spanish Speakers

    - Many Spanish speakers try to pronounce every letter, but in English, “-ed” is often muted, sometimes even silent except for /ɪd/.[10][17]
    - Practice saying the verb with the sound and pay attention to whether your throat vibrates (voiced) or air simply pushes out (unvoiced).[5]

    ### Practice

    Try saying these: worked, laughed, played, wanted, ended. Notice the ending changes depending on the base verb’s last sound.[7][1][5]

    Each of these rules will help to make English spoken past tense and participle forms sound natural and easy to understand.

## Mistral

### without rolo prompt

    In English, the pronunciation of the **past participle ending** (usually **-ed**) depends on the sound that comes before it. Here’s how to pronounce it correctly:

    ### 1. **/t/ sound**
       - After **voiceless consonants** (except /t/):
         - **Voiceless consonants:** /p/, /k/, /f/, /s/, /ʃ/, /tʃ/
         - Examples:
           - **walked** /wɔːkt/
           - **laughed** /læft/
           - **washed** /wɒʃt/

    ### 2. **/d/ sound**
       - After **voiced consonants** or **vowels** (except /d/):
         - **Voiced consonants:** /b/, /g/, /v/, /z/, /ʒ/, /dʒ/, /m/, /n/, /ŋ/, /l/, /r/
         - **Vowels:** /æ/, /e/, /ɪ/, /ɔː/, /ʊ/, etc.
         - Examples:
           - **played** /pleɪd/
           - **loved** /lʌvd/
           - **answered** /ˈɑːnsərd/

    ### 3. **/ɪd/ sound**
       - After **/t/** or **/d/** sounds:
         - Examples:
           - **wanted** /ˈwɒntɪd/
           - **needed** /ˈniːdɪd/

    ---
    **Tip:** Listen for the last sound of the base verb to decide which ending to use.

### With role prompt

    Absolutely! Let’s break down the pronunciation of **regular past participles** in English for Spanish speakers at an A2 level.

    ---

    ## 1. **What is a past participle?**
    In English, the past participle is a verb form used in perfect tenses and passive voice. For **regular verbs**, it ends in **-ed**:
    - walk → walked
    - play → played
    - want → wanted

    ---

    ## 2. **How to Pronounce the -ed Ending**
    The pronunciation of **-ed** depends on the **last sound** of the verb’s base form. There are **three possible sounds**:

    | Ending Sound of Base Verb | Example Verb | -ed Pronunciation | Example (Past Participle) |
    |---------------------------|--------------|--------------------|---------------------------|
    | **/t/ or /d/**            | want, end     | /ɪd/ (like “id”)   | wanted, ended             |
    | **Voiceless sound** (p, k, f, s, ʃ, tʃ) | jump, look, laugh | /t/ (like “t”) | jumped, looked, laughed |
    | **Vowel or voiced sound** (b, g, v, z, ʒ, dʒ, m, n, ŋ, l, r, etc.) | play, love, clean | /d/ (like “d”) | played, loved, cleaned |

    ---

    ### **Key for Spanish Speakers:**
    - **/t/**: Like the Spanish “t” in “taza” (but sharper, no “s” sound).
    - **/d/**: Like the Spanish “d” in “dado” (soft, not like “th”).
    - **/ɪd/**: Like the Spanish “id” in “ida” (an extra syllable).

    ---

    ## 3. **Practice Tips**
    - **Listen and repeat**: Use apps or videos to hear the difference.
    - **Record yourself**: Compare your pronunciation with native speakers.
    - **Minimal pairs**: Practice words like “laugh” vs. “laughed,” “love” vs. “loved.”

    ---

    ## 4. **Common Mistakes**
    - Adding an extra syllable to all -ed endings (e.g., “play-ed” instead of “playd”).
    - Pronouncing -ed as /e/ or /ed/ when it should be /t/ or /d/.
